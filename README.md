## PyF1 Telemetry

### A little about the project.

I am an avid fan of Formula 1 and I have been playing and watching the series for almost a decade now. I am getting more serious with the game and realizing that I need to have instant availability of certain information while I am driving. I cannot be arsed fiddling around with buttons, cycling through menus. I have looked into some tools online for this and generally they cost money. I took on a little challenge with myself to learn about how the UDP telemetry system works and how I can manipulate it to imitate what is on the market now, but for free, minus the cost of time.

### How will it work?

My goal, once the underlying client system is built and handling of data is complete, I will be developing an app or webpage that you can access on your mobile phone or tablet. You will be able to display all the data that you want. You will, at least in theory, just have to run the python client, and then access the app or webpage. 

### How long will it take?

No idea, I am currently working on this pretty actively since it is fun an exciting but I do not know if this will be a long term project, unless there becomes a need for it outside of my own need.
